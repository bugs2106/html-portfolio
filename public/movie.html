<h1>The Best Movies According to Bhakti</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Wednesday</h3>
<p>
  A dark, quirky series with a perfect mix of mystery and humor. Loved the
  aesthetic and Wednesday’s bold personality.
</p>

<h3>2. Fantastic Four</h3>
<p>
  A fun superhero movie with cool powers and a light, adventurous vibe. Easy
  watch with entertaining action.
</p>

<h3>3. Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning</h3>
<p>
  Fast-paced action with intense stunts and slick spy moments. Classic Tom
  Cruise chaos — very entertaining to watch.
